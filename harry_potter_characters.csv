Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,J. K. Rowling came up with the idea for the book after the train she was on (which was returning to London) was delayed for four hours.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Scholastic published in November 2000 a Collector's Edition that includes a pen-and-ink drawing by J.K. Rowling of Harry Potter at no.4 Privet Drive (which was then published on Pottermore) with a unique note. A 10th Anniversary Edition featuring a drawing and a note about Severus Snape by J.K. Rowling was also published by Scholastic in 2008.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"To mark the 20th anniversary of first publication, Bloomsbury Publishing published four House Editions of the book in 2017. The 20th Anniversary Editions each feature the individual house crest on the jacket and sprayed edges in the house colours. New extra content includes fact files, profiles of favourite characters and line illustrations exclusive to each house.[3]"
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"A first edition of the book containing hand drawings and annotations (with a total of 43 personal additions: 20 original illustrations as well as comments scrawled in the margins) by J.K. Rowling was sold at an auction for £150,000 in 2013.[4][5] It has been on exhibit at the Edinburgh's Writers' Museum since Thursday, 8 December 2016.[6][7]"
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,This was the only book to be written during the time the events in the books were taking place.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"This is the only book in the series to be released before the defeat of Lord Voldemort on 2 May, 1998."
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,This book and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban are the only two books in the series to not have a chapter title named after the title of the book.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"For Chapter 5, sitting under a tree in a local park in Edinburgh, J. K. Rowling came up with the passage which was the introduction of Ollivanders.[8]"

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Nearly Headless Nick was petrified, but as a ghost, he would be unable to drink the Mandrake Potion. It is unknown how Nick was revived. It is possible that, as the same way ghosts taste, they poured the potion through him."

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"This novel establishes the date in which Harry Potter takes place. During Nearly-Headless Nick's party, his cake says that it's his 500th Deathday, and his death took place in 1492. This means that the events of ""Chamber of Secrets"" takes place during the year 1992-1993, meaning that Harry Potter's school years take place during the 1990s."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"The warning written on the wall, ""Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever,"" was actually realised. Though originally written in reference to Ginny Weasley, the message can be reinterpreted as being in reference to the Serpent of Slytherin, as the basilisk was in fact a female. Thus her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"An interesting note is that in some translated versions of the book, the true name of Lord Voldemort is changed to form an anagram that made sense for the scene he makes his name into ""I am Lord Voldemort"". In Spanish, it would be ""SOY LORD VOLDEMORT"", so he is called Tom Sorvolo Ryddle. The other names are:"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Many fans noted that Dumbledore said that Voldemort was the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin, instead of descendant. J. K. Rowling said this was a ""deliberate mistake"". This could support the theory that time travel will recur in the series (see ""Rumour"" note for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban). This mistake was fixed on further printings, though, so it's more likely to be a mistake that slipped past the editors than an actual hint. Some versions have put it back after Rowling's comment, perhaps overlooking the tongue-in-cheek nature of the term ""deliberate mistake"". This line was left out of the film."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"It was implied in the book that Ginny had sent Harry his singing valentine. Some members of the on-line fandom have questioned this conclusion, suggesting it being a prank by the Weasley Twins or a genuine overture from Moaning Myrtle as other possibilities. Rowling, herself, however, confirmed in an interview that the valentine was sent by Ginny.[1]"

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Along with Half-Blood Prince, this is one of the books in the series in which the US and UK cover artwork depict the same scene and the same characters. In addition, most cover artwork for any edition in any country depicts this scene, with the exceptions being the Adult version, the Signature Bloomsbury version, the fully illustrated version and the German version. Incidentally, these two books both feature a character in the title other than Harry Potter."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Rowling's original plan was for Aunt Petunia to be inflated, as seen at the end of the second book."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Prisoner of Azkaban and Philosopher's Stone are the only books that do not have a chapter with the same title as the book.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Although somewhat darker than the first book, this one holds the distinction of being the only Harry Potter book where no one actually dies during the events of the book (with the possible exception of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, where the Basilisk, a magical creature of indeterminate sentience, was the only being to die). Although it appears that Buckbeak dies, he was in fact saved by the time-travelling Harry and Hermione. What the trio thought was the execution was in fact Macnair swinging his axe into a stump out of frustration."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"This is one of only two books, along with the Half-Blood Prince, where Voldemort does not appear in person.
This is the only book where Voldemort is not seen at all, even in memories, although he is mentioned numerous times. In fact, he is not only not the main antagonist, but he has almost nothing to do directly with the events of the book."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"This is the only book where Voldemort is not seen at all, even in memories, although he is mentioned numerous times. In fact, he is not only not the main antagonist, but he has almost nothing to do directly with the events of the book."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"This is the first of two books in which the title refers to a character, the other being the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"This is the only book in the series whose name has a word completely original to the series, this word being ""Azkaban""."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,This is also the only book in the series in which the title is not referred to at all in the text (the phrase 'prisoner of Azkaban' never appears in the book.)
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"One of the biggest morals from the series is that it is not one's abilities that make them who they are; it is their choices. However, the climax of this book possibly creates a predestination paradox, which, essentially, negates the doctrine of free will."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,This is the only book where the main antagonist is not directly or indirectly (in the case of book 5) influenced by Voldemort or is Voldemort himself.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"When Harry restrained Lupin and Sirius from killing Pettigrew, he (arguably) made the first mistake that led to the second rise of Lord Voldemort."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban introduces four different magical elements that take on a unique property based on the specific wizard—the Dementor (which causes a wizard to experience their worst memories), the Boggart (which takes the form of a wizard's greatest fear), the Patronus Charm (which creates an animal guardian specific to each wizard), and the Animagus transformation (in which a wizard may transform into an animal form that is unknown to them until they undergo the transformation for the first time.)"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Professor Lupin prevented Harry from confronting the Boggart in the cabinet because he feared that the Boggart would turn into Lord Voldemort. However, Harry didn't know what Voldemort really looked like, since his only encounter at this point with Voldemort was during the Philosopher's Stone two years ago, when he was possessing Professor Quirrell, not to mention Harry had never seen any kind of drawing or photograph of Voldemort. So, the Boggart might have taken Quirrell's form if Harry's fear was Lord Voldemort, potentially that of the face of Lord Voldemort which emerged from the back of Quirrell's head."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"The first book in which Harry does not prevent the return of Lord Voldemort. Instead, he arguably helps Voldemort return by stopping Sirius Black and Remus Lupin from killing Peter Pettigrew, who in turn would help Voldemort return to his body in the next book."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"This book breaks a lot of the plot details from the previous two books. Them being; This is the first book in the series where the climax doesn't take place in an underground chamber of Hogwarts, the first book where Dumbledore is present at Hogwarts during the climax (as he was absent from the school in the first two books' climax), the first of only two books in the series where Voldemort doesn't appear, and the only book in the series where Voldemort isn't the main villain."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Another bit of foreshadowing takes place in the chapter Aunt Marge's Big Mistake. When Uncle Vernon watches the news report about Sirius Black, he gets mad that the reporter didn't say where he escaped from and comments, ""Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!"" He does not know that in a week, this will be true."

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"The book presents the second out of five instances in which the opening narrative is not delivered through a point of view close to Harry: The first instance is in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 1 (The Boy Who Lived) which is told from the perspective of Vernon Dursley. The second instance is Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 1 (The Riddle House), from the perspective of the Muggle caretaker, Frank Bryce. The third instance is in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 1 (The Other Minister) told from the perspective of the British Minister. The fourth instance is in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 2 (Spinner's End) told from the perspective of Narcissa Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. The final instance is in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 1 (The Dark Lord Ascending) told from the perspective of nearly all of the Death Eaters."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"The book presents a greater international aspect to the wizarding community: the Quidditch World Cup; the Triwizard Tournament and two other European wizarding schools, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; an unnamed wizarding school in Brazil; and an American wizarding institute, are either shown or mentioned."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"Due to the uncertainty over what the book's title would be, the American audiobook by Jim Dale simply calls it ""the fourth volume in the Harry Potter series""."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"The book mentions the name of a real person - Natalie McDonald, a nine-year-old girl from Toronto, Canada, who was dying of leukaemia. She wrote to Rowling asking what was going to happen in the next Harry Potter book as she would not live long enough to read it. The former emailed back, but Natalie had died a day earlier. In tribute, she became a first-year student at Hogwarts named by the Sorting Hat in Gryffindor - the house for the brave at heart - in the fourth book. When Rowling was later in Canada for a promotional tour she visited the McDonald family. With the exception of historical people such as Nicolas Flamel, this is the only Harry Potter book to so honour an individual."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"Dumbledore was said to have a ""gleam of triumph"" in his eyes when told that Voldemort had restored his body using Harry's blood, at the end of Goblet of Fire (Ch. 36). Rowling has confirmed that this is ""still enormously significant"". It turned out that this was very significant because when Voldemort used Harry's blood to revive himself he made it so that as long as he lived Harry could not die, as revealed in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"In Hogsmeade, Sirius implied that at a certain point, Snape's attendance at Hogwarts overlapped with Lestrange's. It could have meant Rodolphus or Rabastan Lestrange, Bellatrix's husband and brother-in-law respectively, as Bellatrix would have left school about two years before Snape started."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"In the film version, it was heavily implied by the sheer number of students that everyone from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang made the trip to Hogwarts. However, in the book, it was mentioned that after the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students entered the school and the Hallowe'en feast began, there were only about twenty extra students in the Great Hall. Igor Karkaroff also said in the book (during the argument about letting Harry Potter participate in the Triwizard Tournament) that he would have brought more students to Hogwarts if he had known younger students could enter the Tournament."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"At the end of Prisoner of Azkaban, Cornelius Fudge mentioned possibly bringing a dragon to Hogwarts to guard the school. Ironically, the Ministry does bring dragons to Hogwarts, although for a different purpose."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"In the chapter entitled ""The Unforgivable Curses"" when Harry and Ron are doing their Divination homework, some of their fake prophecies could be considered as coming true throughout the book. For example, ""stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend,"" may refer to Ron feeling betrayed by Harry becoming a Triwizard Champion since he thought Harry really did put his name in the Goblet without telling him. And possibly feeling slightly jealous at Harry's many achievements (whether deserved or not) and when Hermione points out Ron's apparent double drowning it could be interpreted as foreshadowing to she and Ron being placed at the bottom of the lake during the second task."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"Cedric's death marked the first occasion in the series where a protagonist is killed off (excluding minor characters such as Frank Bryce, and deaths that occurred outside of the action, such as Lily and James.) In every book after this, at least one main character dies. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Sirius Black is murdered by his cousin Bellatrix Lestrange. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Albus Dumbledore is murdered by Severus Snape. Finally, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, a number of protagonists are killed. These deaths include Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, Fred Weasley, Severus Snape, Dobby, Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Lavender Brown, and Colin Creevey."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"This book is also very significant as it is not only the very middle book in the series, but it is the one in which Lord Voldemort comes back into power after gaining his own body. Therefore, this book is instrumental in changing not only the tone, but also the story structure for the remainder of the series."

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"In Chapter 1, Harry hears about a high profile celebrity divorce. Based on timing it may be the divorce of Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson, who divorced in 1995 after Branagh cheated on Thompson with Helena Bonham Carter. All three appear in the film series as Gilderoy Lockhart, Sybil Trelawney, and Bellatrix Lestrange, respectively."
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"The phone number to get into the Ministry of Magic is 62442, which can be used to spell ""magic"" on a telephone keypad."
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"When the group of students arrive at the Hog's Head for the first D.A. meeting, Fred and George Weasley arrive last, but then Fred jumps to the front of the group to reach the barman first."
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"When Umbridge is inspecting Snape and Harry's potion is ruined, Snape gives him a zero and an essay to write on what he did wrong. Harry then says that he has Quidditch practice; but just that morning, Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four had been enforced and the Gryffindor Quidditch team had not been approved yet, although he hadn't realised that Quidditch teams were included in the Decree too."
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,It is the first book in the series to be released while the movies were being produced.
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"This is the biggest book in the series, being over 700 pages in the UK edition and over 800 pages in the US edition."

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Along with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, this is one of the books in the series where the cover art for the UK and US editions depicts the same subjects."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"This, along with Chamber of Secrets, was the only book that did not end in King's Cross. (Chamber of Secrets ends in Platform nine and three quarters and the final sentence is going to King's Cross which does not count because no dialogue was shown in King's Cross)."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Before its release, a rumour circulated a chapter was to be entitled, ""Lupin's Papers."" Rowling responded that this was not the case, ""nor will there be chapters entitled 'Pettigrew's Pamphlets,' 'Sirius' Circulars' or 'The Pocket Crosswords of Severus Snape'.""[1]"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Between the release of Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows, fans wondered who ""R.A.B."" could be; many people believed it to be Regulus Black. J. K. Rowling would not explicitly say it was Regulus, but commented that he was a ""good guess."" Between the releases of the two books, she would drop hints about R.A.B.'s identity; one such hint was that the final book would introduce no new characters: this led many fans to believe it had to be a character introduced in a previous book."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"When Harry is hiding the Half-Blood Prince's book in the Room of Requirement, he opens a cupboard and inside is something in a cage that had long-since died; its skeleton had five legs; this could possibly be the skeleton of a Quintaped."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Many readers believed that Dumbledore was not actually dead, and postulated many theories to explain how his death had been faked. A website was even created entitled ""Dumbledoreisnotdead.com"". J.K. Rowling later stated in an interview that ""Dumbledore is definitely dead."" This was definitively confirmed in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"In the Simpsons episode ""The Bob Next Door"", Sideshow Bob spoils the book's ending by revealing that Snape killed Dumbledore, to which Bart complains he hadn't gotten to that part yet and Sideshow Bob responds ""It's a four year old book!""."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Also, in the Big Bang Theory episode ""The Spoiler Alert Segmentation"", Sheldon reveals Dumbledore's death to Leonard while he reads it, much to his anger (though the book would have been seven years old at the time)."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"This is the first book in the series where Harry was right about who the enemy was. In Philosopher's Stone they thought Snape was after the stone when it was Quirrell; in Chamber of Secrets they thought Malfoy opened the Chamber of Secrets, and that Hagrid opened it the first time, when it was really Riddle on both occasions; in Prisoner of Azkaban, everyone thought Sirius was a mass murderer and follower of Voldemort, when it was really Pettigrew; and in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, they thought Karkaroff put Harry's name in the Goblet of Fire when it was really Barty Crouch Jnr."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape is revealed to be the Half-Blood Prince. This marks the second time someone at Hogwarts is revealed to be a wizard under a different name. The first was Tom Riddle when he was revealed to be Voldemort in Chamber of Secrets.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,This also marks the second time Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy duel.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"This marks Draco Malfoy's first trip to Diagon Alley, and Knockturn Alley, since Chamber of Secrets (although it is very likely that he visited each year in between, but did not meet Harry there.)"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"The Spanish version, the name is Harry Potter y el Misterio del Príncipe, which means Harry Potter and the Mystery of the Prince. Something similar happens in the second book."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Slughorn called Ron Rupert during Aragog's funeral, ironically, the actor that plays Ron in the films is called Rupert Grint. J.K Rowling may have intentionally done this, as she would obviously be aware that Rupert Grint played Ron Weasley in the film adaptations of the books."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cheryl Klein served as the title's continuity editor.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"The first chapter, ""The Other Minister,"" is a re-purpose of an early draft for the first chapter of the first title, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. In this draft, Rubeus Hagrid visited Cornelius Fudge, who was the Prime Minister of muggles, to inform him of Voldemort being responsible for a number of disappearances and to ask him to alert the public of certain facts. Fudge fears that Vernon Dursley, his political opponent, will try to take his position, only to learn that Dursley is already aware of the existence of wizards. The chapter ends with Hagrid informing Dursley of Voldemort's disappearance, due to Voldemort's attempt to kill Harry. This draft can be read in Harry Potter: A Journey Through a History of Magic."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Although Lord Voldemort (as well as the previous Tom Riddle) appear in numerous memories, he never appears in person. This one of only two books, after the Prisoner of Azkaban, where he does not make an appearance. However, he is still the primary protagonist, unlike the Prisoner of Azkaban where he is almost completely irrelevant to the plot."

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,13 Notes and references
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,Dr Neil Murray is Jo's husband.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"Jessica, David, and Mackenzie are her children."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"Di is Jo's younger sister, Dianne."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"Anne is Jo's mother, who died at 45 of MS. (Although Jo's mother did not know of the books since she died early on, Jo has said her death had a profound influence on how the series was written)."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,The final dedication is to all the fans who have made Harry's journey their own.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"The seven dedications could be a reference to the seven books in the series, or seven Horcruxes, or the fact that seven is the most powerful magical number."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"To Ron, the Deluminator, with the power to douse all lights in the surrounding area."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"To Hermione, The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a book of wizard-culture fairy tales written in Runes."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"To Harry, Godric Gryffindor's Sword, and the first Golden Snitch Harry had ever caught in a Hogwarts Quidditch match."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,J. K. Rowling finished writing this book on 11 January 2007 in an unknown hotel room.[5]
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"This book is noted for containing more and stronger profanity than in the other books; Aberforth Dumbledore called the three Muggle children who attacked his sister, Ariana Dumbledore ""bastards"" and the trio ""bloody fools"", Hermione Granger called Ron Weasley an ""arse"", Ron Weasley called Draco Malfoy a ""two-faced bastard"" and, most notably, Molly Weasley called Bellatrix Lestrange a ""bitch"". The series covers such profanities, such as when Ron Weasley insulted Severus Snape in the third book (Chapter 9, Grim Defeat), it did not reveal the words Ron used, and when Lee Jordan insulted Draco Malfoy for playing foul in Quidditch, the word was not revealed either (Chapter 15, The Quidditch Final), and when Ron told Draco to ""go and do something that Harry was sure he would have never said in front of Mrs Weasley"". Ron also said 'effing', which is a bowdlerised version of 'f**king'. While other books had used minor instances of strong language, they had never delved beyond ""damn"" or ""hell"" (although this book uses such words with a generally higher frequency than the first six books). The previous book similarly contained some strong language, but not as much as in this book. For example, Morfin calls Merope a ""slut"" for marrying a Muggle."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"The Three Peverell brothers are connected to Harry Potter, Severus Snape and Lord Voldemort due to the way they die. Lord Voldemort and Antioch Peverell die for power. Severus Snape and Cadmus Peverell die for love. And Harry Potter and Ignotus Peverell greet Death as an old friend and depart that life for good. It is stated that Lord Voldemort is distantly related to Cadmus, as is Harry to Ignotus."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"In chapter seven, when Harry discusses Ginny with Ron, Harry says ""It's not as if I'm going to marry her!"" Ironically, he is married to her in the epilogue."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,This is the only book in the series to not feature any Quidditch matches.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"In the episode of iCarly (iFence), Sam Puckett can be seen reading the American version of the 7th book because of the red page and the cover if the sleeve is removed. Freddie Benson betted her to read ""The Penny Treasure"", a fake cover was used to disguise the book in this episode."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"Angela Biola was the manufacturing director for the American edition of this title, Karyn Browne was the managing editor and Cheryl Klein was the continuity editor."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"In the long running series Doctor Who, the 10th Doctor played by David Tennant said that he had cried when he read book 7 which had not yet come out at the time. Coincidentally, David Tennant portrayed Barty Crouch Jnr, a main antagonist, in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. In another Harry Potter reference in the same episode, William Shakespeare used Expeliarmus as the end of a formula to defeat the bad guys at the suggestion of protagonist Martha Jones, causing the Doctor to quip ""good old J.K."" with a smile."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"The contents of the book were treated with the utmost secrecy prior to its release, such that not even a basic preview summary was released, unlike past Harry Potter titles. The book was marketed with the simple phrase ""We now present the seventh and final instalment in the epic tale of Harry Potter."" The text was present on the inside cover of all library-edition releases of the novel, as opposed to the brief premise of the book that was present in the previous 6 novels.[6]"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,Rowling introduced her favourite scene from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in The Birthday Book[7] with illustrations by Quentin Blake.[8]
